    <h5 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING</h5>.
    <p class="stage-direction">
        [_Pulls out his watch_, _inspects it_, _and rings the
        bell_.]
    </p> It is a great nuisance. I can’t find any one in this house to
    talk to. And I am full of interesting information. I feel like the
    latest edition of something or other.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
    <p class="stage-direction">
        [_Enter servant_.]
    </p>

    <h5 class="name james">JAMES</h5>. Sir Robert is still at the Foreign Office, my lord.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h5 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING</h5>. Lady Chiltern not down yet?
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h5 class="name james">JAMES</h5>. Her ladyship has not yet left her room. Miss Chiltern has just
    come in from riding.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">

    <h5 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING</h5>. <p class="stage-direction">
        [_To himself_.]
    </p> Ah! that is something.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
    <h5 class="name james">JAMES</h5>. <h5 class="name  lord-caversham">LORD CAVERSHAM</h5> has been waiting some time
    in the library for Sir
    Robert. I told him your lordship was here.

    </p>

    <p class="speech">

    <h5 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING</h5>. Thank you! Would you kindly tell him I’ve gone?
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h5 class="name james">JAMES</h5>. <p class="stage-direction">
        [_Bowing_.]
    </p> I shall do so, my lord.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
    <p class="stage-direction">
        [_Exit servant_.]

    </p>

    <h5 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING</h5>. Really, I don’t want to meet my father three days running.
    It is a great deal too much excitement for any son. I hope to goodness
    he won’t come up. Fathers should be neither seen nor heard. That is the
    only proper basis for family life. Mothers are different. Mothers are
    darlings.
    <p class="stage-direction">
        [_Throws himself down into a chair_, _picks up a paper and
        begins to read it_.]
    </p>
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
    <h5 class="name  lord-caversham">LORD CAVERSHAM</h5>.

    <h5 class="name  lord-caversham">LORD CAVERSHAM</h5>. Well, sir, what are you doing here? Wasting your time
    as usual, I suppose?
    </p>

    <p class="speech">

    <h5 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING</h5>.
    <p class="stage-direction">
        [_Throws down paper and rises_.]
    </p> My dear father, when one
    pays a visit it is for the purpose of wasting other people’s time, not
    one’s own.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">

    <h5 class="name  lord-caversham">LORD CAVERSHAM</h5>. Have you been thinking over what I spoke to you about
    last night?
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h5 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING</h5>. I have been thinking about nothing else.

    </p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h5 class="name  lord-caversham">LORD CAVERSHAM</h5>. Engaged to be married yet?

    </p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h5 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING</h5>. Not yet: but I hope to be before lunch-time.

    </p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h5 class="name  lord-caversham">LORD CAVERSHAM</h5>. <p class="stage-direction">
        [_Caustically_.]
    </p> You can have till dinner-time if it
    would be of any convenience to you.

    </p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h5 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING</h5>. Thanks awfully, but I think I’d sooner be engaged before
    lunch.

    </p>

    <p class="speech">

    <h5 class="name  lord-caversham">LORD CAVERSHAM</h5>. Humph! Never know when you are serious or not.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">

    <h5 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING</h5>. Neither do I, father.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">
    <p class="stage-direction">
        [_A pause_.]

    </p>

    <h5 class="name  lord-caversham">LORD CAVERSHAM</h5>. I suppose you have read _The Times_ this morning?
    </p>

    <p class="speech">

    <h5 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING</h5>. <p class="stage-direction">
        [_Airily_.]
    </p> The Times? Certainly not. I only read _The
    Morning Post_. All that one should know about modern life is where the
    Duchesses are; anything else is quite demoralising.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">

    <h5 class="name  lord-caversham">LORD CAVERSHAM</h5>. Do you mean to say you have not read _The Times_ leading
    article on Robert Chiltern’s career?
    </p>

    <p class="speech">

    <h5 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING</h5>. Good heavens! No. What does it say?
    </p>

    <p class="speech">

    <h5 class="name  lord-caversham">LORD CAVERSHAM</h5>. What should it say, sir? Everything complimentary, of
    course. Chiltern’s speech last night on this Argentine Canal scheme was
    one of the finest pieces of oratory ever delivered in the House since
    Canning.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h5 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING</h5>. Ah! Never heard of Canning. Never wanted to. And did . . .
    did Chiltern uphold the scheme?

    </p>

    <p class="speech">

    <h5 class="name  lord-caversham">LORD CAVERSHAM</h5>. Uphold it, sir? How little you know him! Why, he
    denounced it roundly, and the whole system of modern political finance.
    This speech is the turning-point in his career, as _The Times_ points
    out. You should read this article, sir. [_Opens_ The Times.] ‘Sir
    Robert Chiltern . . . most rising of our young statesmen . . . Brilliant
    Orator . . . Unblemished career . . . Well-known integrity of character
    . . . Represents what is best in English public life . . . Noble contrast
    to the lax morality so common among foreign politicians.’ They will
    never say that of you, sir.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">

    <h5 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING</h5>. I sincerely hope not, father. However, I am delighted at
    what you tell me about Robert, thoroughly delighted. It shows he has got
    pluck.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">

    <h5 class="name  lord-caversham">LORD CAVERSHAM</h5>. He has got more than pluck, sir, he has got genius.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">

    <h5 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING</h5>. Ah! I prefer pluck. It is not so common, nowadays, as
    genius is.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">

    <h5 class="name  lord-caversham">LORD CAVERSHAM</h5>. I wish you would go into Parliament.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">

    <h5 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING</h5>. My dear father, only people who look dull ever get into the
    House of Commons, and only people who are dull ever succeed there.
    </p>
    <p class="speech">

    <h5 class="name  lord-caversham">LORD CAVERSHAM</h5>. Why don’t you try to do something useful in life?
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h5 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING</h5>. I am far too young.

    </p>

    <p class="speech">

    <h5 class="name  lord-caversham">LORD CAVERSHAM</h5>. <p class="stage-direction">
        [_Testily_.]
    </p> I hate this affectation of youth, sir. It
    is a great deal too prevalent nowadays.

    </p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h5 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING</h5>. Youth isn’t an affectation. Youth is an art.

    </p>

    <p class="speech">

    <h5 class="name  lord-caversham">LORD CAVERSHAM</h5>. Why don’t you propose to that pretty Miss Chiltern?
    </p>

    <p class="speech">

    <h5 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING</h5>. I am of a very nervous disposition, especially in the
    morning.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h5 class="name  lord-caversham">LORD CAVERSHAM</h5>. I don’t suppose there is the smallest chance of her
    accepting you.

    </p>

    <p class="speech">

    <h5 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING</h5>. I don’t know how the betting stands to-day.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">

    <h5 class="name  lord-caversham">LORD CAVERSHAM</h5>. If she did accept you she would be the prettiest fool in
    England.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h5 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING</h5>. That is just what I should like to marry. A thoroughly
    sensible wife would reduce me to a condition of absolute idiocy in less
    than six months.

    </p>

    <p class="speech">

    <h5 class="name  lord-caversham">LORD CAVERSHAM</h5>. You don’t deserve her, sir.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">

    <h5 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING</h5>. My dear father, if we men married the women we deserved, we
    should have a very bad time of it.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">
    <h5 class="name"></h5>MABEL CHILTERN</h5>.

    <h5 class="name mabel-chiltern">MABEL CHILTERN</h5>. Oh! . . . How do you do, <h5 class="name  lord-caversham">LORD
        CAVERSHAM</h5>? I hope Lady
    Caversham is quite well?
    </p>
    <p class="speech">

    <h5 class="name  lord-caversham">LORD CAVERSHAM</h5>. Lady Caversham is as usual, as usual.
    </p>

    <p class="speech">

    <h5 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING</h5>. Good morning, Miss Mabel!

    </p> And Lady Caversham’s
    bonnets . . . are they at all better?

    </p>

    <p class="speech">

    <h5 class="name  lord-caversham">LORD CAVERSHAM</h5>. They have had a serious relapse, I am sorry to say.

        [_Smiling at her pertness_.]
    </p> If it is, we shall have to

    have a feather touched.

        [_Turning round with feigned surprise_.]
    </p> Oh, are you
    here? Of course you understand that after your breaking your appointment
    I am never going to speak to you again.

    <p class="speech">

    <h5 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING</h5>. Oh, please don’t say such a thing. You are the one person
    in London I really like to have to listen to me.

    <h5 class="name mabel-chiltern">MABEL CHILTERN</h5>. <h5 class="name lord-goring">LORD GORING</h5>, I never believe

    as he is concerned, I mean.
